# Lethal Gargoyles!

This gargoyle's goal is to follow you around, and annoy you. But be wary, he's not so passive if you don't respect his space.

Any feedback can be posted to my Github repo (link at the top of the page), or my forum in the [Lethal Company Modding Discord community](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1312527029455032394)

This is my first experience with Unity, C#, models, and animations. If you see any way I can improve the code, model, or the mod in general please let me know!

I did all the voice lines myself and I'm willing to take voice line requests for this mod. I can't guarantee that each request will be approved.
