All audio files for voice lines need to be ogg format. I currently can not support mp3, wav, flak, etc.

The clients do not need the custom audio files, only the host. All audio files are loaded on the hosts end when a new game is started. Clients will then be sent the audio upon joining.

You can find "Custom Voice Lines" in the Lethal Company game folder. Usually located in your steam directory. For example "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company"

Please refrain from placing voice files in the "Voice Lines" folder. "Custom Voice Lines" is specifically for this purpose.
If you'd simply like to turn a voice line off, you can disable it in the config.

Voice lines a separated into categories; Combat Dialog, Taunt - Activity, Taunt - Aggro, Taunt - Enemy, Taunt - Gargoyle Death, Taunt - General, Taunt - Player Death, and Taunt - Prior Death.

Certain categories have their names hard coded into the mod. For these categories, if you want custom audio the name must match one of the originals.
	- For example:
		If you'd like to add a prior death taunt like "taunt_priordeath_Abandoned" then name your ogg audio file "taunt_priordeath_Abandoned". Any names that don't match won't be used.

	Hard Coded Categories: Taunt - Activity, Taunt - Enemy, Taunt - Prior Death
	
The other categories are not name specific. Simply stick an ogg file in the corresponding folder and it will be loaded and used.
	- For example:
		If you'd like to add a new general taunt, then stick your ogg audio file into the "Custom Voice Lines/Taunt - General" folder.
