Gargoyle To Do:
- Create system to track specific actions gargoyles can use to taunt players.
	- Kill enemy.
	- Pick up certain scrap items.
	- Stay too long in the facility.
- 1 more taunt for each employee class.
- Add gargoyle scrap that taunts (probably lower volume than the monster).
- Mirage integration. Gargoyle "Repeats" voice lines in a mocking manner.
