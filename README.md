# Lethal Gargoyles!

This mischievous gargoyle's goal is to follow you around and annoy you with his witty taunts. But be wary, he's not so passive if you don't respect his space!

[![Lethal Gargoyles Mod Showcase](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FBGAoOVgEUk0)](https://youtu.be/BGAoOVgEUk0)

## Features:

* **Voiced Gargoyle:**  Features the voice of the modder, with 160+ unique voice lines (and more to come!).
* **Dynamic Behavior:** The gargoyle tries to stay close while remaining hidden, but will become aggressive if you get too close.
* **Varied Taunts:**  Includes a wide range of taunts for different situations, including general taunts, aggro responses, death reactions, and more.
* **Customizable Voice Lines:**  Add or replace voice lines with your own custom OGG files. (Details on how are below)
* **Scrap Item:**  Adds a Gargoyle Statue as scrap that can be interacted with to hear the Gargoyle's voice lines. Be careful, the Eyeless Dog can hear it too!
* **Configuration Options:** Disable specific voice lines or adjust other settings through the mod's configuration file.

<summary>Gargoyle Behavior (Spoilers)</summary>

- The gargoyle's primary goal is to annoy the player. It will try to stay close while remaining hidden, but its stealth skills are still under development.
- If the player enters its aggro range, it will chase and attack them. Be careful, as it might occasionally push you into walls (a bug that's being worked on).
- If the target player is walking on a catwalk, the gargoyle will try to push the player, potentially off the catwalk!

## Feedback and Requests

Any feedback or voice line requests can be submitted through the following channels:

* **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/DropDaDeuce/LethalGargoyles
* **Lethal Company Modding Discord:** https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1312527029455032394

This is my first experience with Unity, C#, models, and animations. Any suggestions for improvement are welcome!

## Add/Replace Voice Lines
<details>

**1. Audio Format and Location**

- All custom voice lines **must be in OGG format**. Other formats (MP3, WAV, etc.) are not supported.
- Place your custom OGG files in the **"Custom Voice Lines"** folder located within your Lethal Company game directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company\Custom Voice Lines`).
- **Do not** place custom voice lines in the "Voice Lines" folder.
- There is a maximum size of **500KB** on the OGG files due to Steam networking limitations on network messages.

**2.  Voice Line Categories**

Voice lines are organized into the following categories:

- Combat Dialog
- Taunt - Activity
- Taunt - Aggro
- Taunt - Enemy
- Taunt - Gargoyle Death
- Taunt - General
- Taunt - Player Death
- Taunt - Prior Death
- Taunt - EmployeeClass (Requires the Employee Classes mod)
- Taunt - SteamIDs

**3.  Naming Conventions**

- **Hardcoded Categories:** For the categories "Taunt - Activity," "Taunt - Enemy," "Taunt - Prior Death," and "Taunt - EmployeeClass," you can add multiple variations of the same taunt by using the original file name as a base and adding a suffix.
    - For example, to add variations of the "taunt_priordeath_Abandoned" voice line, you can name your custom OGG files "taunt_priordeath_Abandoned2.ogg", "taunt_priordeath_Abandoned_Custom.ogg", etc. The mod will randomly choose between all variations with the same base name.
- **Other Categories:**  For the remaining categories, you can use any file name for your custom OGG files. Simply place them in the corresponding folder within "Custom Voice Lines."

**4. Disabling Voice Lines**

- If you want to disable a specific voice line, you can do so through the mod's configuration file.

**5. Steam ID Taunts**

- If you want to add a custom taunt for a specific Steam ID, you can do so by naming the OGG file "[SteamID][optional text].ogg" (e.g., "76561198012345678_ConorTaunt.ogg" or "76561198012345678.ogg"). The Gargoyle will play this custom taunt when the player with the specified Steam ID is the target.
- There is a 2.5% chance that the Gargoyle will play a Steam ID taunt. This is to prevent these taunts from being overused.
    - If the player has multiple Steam ID taunts, the Gargoyle will randomly choose one to play.

## Compatibility
- Enhanced Monsters
    - Sets default values for Enhanced Monsters
- Coroner
    - Specific voice lines for coroner cause of death
    - Adds custom cause of death message for gargoyle
- Employee Classes
    - Adds taunts for each class.

## To Do
- 1 more taunt for each employee class.
- Add 
- **MAYBE** add Mirage integration. Gargoyle "Repeats" voice lines in a mocking manner. (Depends on difficulty and time to implement)
- Thinking of new ways to make the Gargoyle michievous without it being overbearing.
