# Lethal Gargoyles!

This gargoyle's goal is to follow you around, and annoy you. But be wary, he's not so passive if you don't respect his space.
He is voiced by yours truely, with 140 voice lines (more will be added as time goes on).

<summary>Gargoyle Behavior (Spoilers)</summary>
<pre>
His goal is to annoy the player. Because of this he is mostly passive, and will try to stay close and out of sight of all players. Currently he's not to great at the staying out of sight part, but he tries. 
If the player gets within his aggro range, he will start chasing them and hitting them. On rare occasions he can push you into walls, please be carefull of this, I'm trying to fix it.
His taunts vary and currently have several catagories: General, Aggro, Gargoyle Death, Player Death, Enemy Proximity, and Prior Death.
